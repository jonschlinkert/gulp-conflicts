> Detects when a (new) vinyl file is different than an existing file on the file system, and either prompts the user for action, skips the file, or calls a function on the file to determine the action to take.

Please consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), and consider starring the project to show your :heart: and support.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save gulp-conflicts
```

## Usage

Pass the same destination value (string or function) to the `conflicts()` plugin that you pass to `gulp.dest()`. This is necessary so the plugin can check for existing files that may conflict with (proposed) files before they are written.

```js
const conflicts = require('gulp-conflicts');
const gulp = require('gulp');

gulp.task('default', () => {
  let dest = file => path.join(file.base, 'foo');

  return gulp.src('*.js')
    .pipe(conflicts(dest))
    .pipe(gulp.dest(dest));
});
```

## File detection

1. The existing file's contents is compared with `file.contents` on the vinyl file
2. If the contents of both are identical, no action is taken, the file is skipped
3. If the contents differ, the user is prompted for action
4. If no conflicting file exists, the vinyl file is written to the file system

**Params**

* `dest` **{String}**: The same desination directory passed to `app.dest()`
* `returns` **{String}**

**Example**

```js
app.src('foo/*.js')
  .pipe(conflicts('foo'))
  .pipe(app.dest('foo'));
```
